#WP-App

WordPress plug-in that allows you to create new data objects in non-core tables.


The plugin has a few primary components:

1. **Models** - defines data (e.g. table, columns, keys), manipulates data (e.g. queries database), and creates Objects.
2. **Objects** - a representation of a table row.
3. **Registry** - stores objects.
4. **App** - initiates app and controls features, etc.
